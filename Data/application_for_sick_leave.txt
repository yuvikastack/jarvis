Subject: Application for Sick Leave

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to attend work for the next few days due to illness. I woke up this morning feeling unwell and after consulting with my doctor, it has been determined that I need to take some time off to recover.

I am sorry for any inconvenience this may cause and I will do my best to ensure that my responsibilities are covered during my absence. I will check my emails periodically and respond to any urgent matters as soon as I am able.

I will provide a medical certificate to support my leave and will keep you updated on my progress. I am hopeful that I will be able to return to work as soon as possible.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time.

Yours sincerely,
[Your Name]
